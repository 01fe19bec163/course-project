This project shows the implementation of single bit error correction using Hamming code for 64 and 128 bit data stream. Hamming code is a single error correction and double error detection algorithm, where the at the sender side the data is encoded with parity bits(even or odd). The parity bits contain result of XOR of certain data bits. At the receiver end , the data bits are seperated and again XOR'ed, the resulting parity bits are compared with the received parity bits. If the parity bits does not match it is learnt that there is a error in the data, the position of which is detected and hence corrected.
